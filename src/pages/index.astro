<Layout title="Home" description="LoyalPotato's lair">
  <main>
    <PageHeader title="Hello!" subtitle="Welcome to my lair!" />
    <p>
      I go by LoyalPotato online, but my real name is David. Either is fine :)
    </p>
    <p>
      Here you'll find what I'm working on and have worked on, all my <LinkBtn
        link="/projects"
        linkText="projects"
      /> and some <LinkBtn link="/posts" linkText="posts" /> about what I find interesting
      in all sorts of topics, such as Typescript, React, C# and others
      <small>(but at the moment none exist)</small>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can go straight to my <LinkBtn link="/about" linkText="about" /> page if
      you want to know about my experiences and a little more about myself.
