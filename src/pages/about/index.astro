    <p>Like I said in the homepage, my name is David/LoyalPotato.</p>

      I'm a software engineer who's curious about all sorts of things, a
      keyboard "enthusiast" <small
        >(I like keyboards but I'm not crazy about 'em)</small
      >. I also like playing video games, even though I haven't played many
      different ones these past years <small
        >(I've been playing mostly Halo Infinite on PC)</small
      > and I occasionally like to draw as well, but much like gaming, I do it way
      less than before, sadly :(
